# STATS 503 Data Challenge

## Main stuff
* `test_labeled.csv` is the outcome of the model on the test data.
* `Data Challenge Summary.pdf` is the final write up giving an overview of what we did.

## Extras
* `stats503DataPreprocessing` contains C++ code to preprocess the .csv files.
* `data` contains the EDA/impute for the data, along with the data sets before and after imputing. You can read the `README.md` in that folder to understand more ofwhat it contains.
* `models` folder contains the code for the three models we tried. Also, at the end of the neural network file, there is the code for running the final model.
