# Data Sets stored here

`trainData.csv` is all the patient data files up to (not including) 7090. I did max, min, mean, range, changeStoF, and numTest for every thing other than the first 4 attributes. Though it is named trainData, it should be split (70/30 or 80/20) for a test set before you do anything. The 7090 on files are for the turn in, so we don't know the results. There are a lot of N/A's, given not every test for every person.
