# Each Variable .csv for EDA and engineering variables.
Once all .csv files are uploaded we can do an EDA on each variable. These EDA's will probably be very repetitive. We just want to see what kind of engineered variable(s) will do nicely for summarizing that particular variable. For example, if we have variable X, then we'd have a file called `X.csv`. This `X.csv` would only contain the patients that had this variable in their data. It will also contain whether or not that patient recovered. So if a patient never had the X test taken, then that patient will *not* be in `X.csv`. From this `X.csv` we can test whether change-over-time matters, or if a general statistic like mean will be sufficient. Once we find at least one (could be more than one) statistic that separates recovered vs. not recovered well, we can use this/these statistic(s) in our final data set. Though there are a lot of variables, we will most likely be running the same tests on every variable. So after the first few it will go pretty quickly.
